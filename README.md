# Excel-Practice-Files
This repository contains various Excel files that I've created to practice and enhance my skills in Microsoft Excel

# File Descriptions:
1. Work Hours Tracker:
    - This Excel file helps in tracking work hours, allowing you to record your work hours daily. It includes features such as start time, end time, break duration, and total hours worked.
    
2. Boolean Expression Combinations Evaluator:
    - This Excel file is a powerful tool for evaluating Boolean expressions and generating all possible combinations of true/false values for the given conditions. Simply input the conditions and operators, and the file will automatically compute and display the combinations.
  
3. Color Converter:
   - This Excel file enables users to input RGB triplets or HEX codes and automatically calculates the conversion to the other format. The conversion results are displayed instantly for user convenience.
   - The file also includes a macro feature that allows users to colour the corresponding cell based on the set colour. The macro intelligently detects the input format (RGB or HEX) and applies the appropriate colour to the cell.
